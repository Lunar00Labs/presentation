My Presentation Script

Start:
“Hello everyone! My name is Aadil, and my ID is 025. Thank you Auli and Zarif. and thank you all for listening to us so carefully.

You have already heard about the story and the characters of the movie The Pursuit of Happyness. Now, I will talk about the life lessons we can learn from this movie. I will also share how the movie can be improved. At the end, I will share the main message of the movie. Let’s start!”

Part 1: Life Lessons
“The Pursuit of Happyness teaches us some very important lessons about life.
 • Never Give Up:
Chris never stopped trying, even when life was very hard. He had no home and no money, but he kept going. This teaches us to stay strong and keep trying, no matter what happens.
 • The Power of Hope:
Hope helped Chris to keep moving forward. Even when he was sad, he believed that better days would come. Hope is like a small light that helps us to never give up.
 • Love and Sacrifice:
Chris loved his son so much. He worked very hard and gave up his own comfort to take care of his son. This shows us that love means making sacrifices for the people we care about.
 • Believe in Yourself:
Chris always believed in himself, even when others didn’t. He kept saying, “I can do this!” This teaches us to believe in ourselves, even when life feels difficult.”

Part 2: Room for Improvement
“Even though the movie is amazing, there are some parts that can be better.
 • Pacing:
Some parts of the movie are slow. If those scenes were faster, the movie would feel more exciting.
 • Supporting Characters:
We don’t know much about the other people in Chris’s life. If we learned more about them, the story would feel deeper and more emotional.
 • Show Real Struggles:
The movie could show more about how hard it is to be homeless. This would make Chris’s journey feel even more powerful and real.”

Conclusion:
“The Pursuit of Happyness is not just a movie. It is a story full of hope and inspiration.
 • It teaches us to never give up on our dreams.
 • It shows that love, hope, and hard work can help us overcome anything.
 • And it reminds us that success is not just about money. True success is about being happy and being a good person.

So, if life ever gets hard, remember Chris’s story and keep moving forward. Nothing is impossible if we keep trying!”
